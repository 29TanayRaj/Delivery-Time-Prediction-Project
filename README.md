**Project: Goods Delivery Time Prediction Project**

**Problem:** An E-commerce company wants to automate to predict whether a product will reach its destination on time or not.

**Purpose:** To gain insights into the company delivery process by leveraging the data generated by the good delivery process. 

**Approch:**: An Exploratory Data analysis was performed on the on the dataset. Different machine learning models were compared and best model was seleted.

- Dataset with **10999** entries was used.
- **EDA** was done on the dataset and insights from the dataset were recored.
- Machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression Classifier**,**KNN Classifier**, **Support Vector Machine**,**Decision Tree Classifier** and more used.
- Model were compared on the basis of **Accuracy Score**,	**Precision	Recall**,	**F1** and **Time Taken** to fit the models.
- To get the best features form the dataset, statitical methods like **Mutual Information Score**,**f-statitic** and **chi-2 statistic**.
- For getting the best performance form the models **GridSearch** was used to select the best hyperparemeters.

**Project Document** - Jupyter Notebook
**Libraries Used** - Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
